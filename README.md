# Weather Dashboard - Cloud Application

## Project Overview

This project is a real-time weather dashboard that fetches weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. The user can input a city name, and the app will display live weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather details. The application is hosted on **Firebase Hosting**, allowing it to be accessed from anywhere.

You can see a live demo of the project at the following link: [Weather Dashboard Demo](https://weather-dashboard-cloudapp.web.app/).

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **OpenWeatherMap API**: For fetching real-time weather data.
- **Firebase Hosting**: For deploying and hosting the web application on the cloud.
- **HTML, CSS**: Front-end technologies to display the weather data.
- **VS Code**: Used as the code editor for development.

## Prerequisites

- **Firebase Account**: You need a Firebase account to deploy the app.
- **OpenWeatherMap API Key**: Sign up on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and get your API key for fetching weather data.

```

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Setup OpenWeatherMap API

1. Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and sign up.
2. Generate an API key for the Weather API.
3. Replace the `apiKey` variable in `script.js` with your own API key.

```javascript
const apiKey = 'your-api-key-here'; // Replace with your OpenWeatherMap API key
```

### Step 2: Install Firebase CLI

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Install Firebase CLI by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

3. After installation, login to Firebase using:

```bash
firebase login
```

### Step 3: Initialize Firebase in Your Project

1. Navigate to your project folder:

```bash
cd weather_dashboard
```

2. Initialize Firebase by running:

```bash
firebase init
```

- Select **Hosting** during setup.
- Choose your Firebase project (or create a new one).
- Set `public` as the folder for your project (Firebase will automatically recognize it).
- Make sure to configure Firebase Hosting as a single-page app if it's a static site.

### Step 4: Create Web Application

1. **index.html**: This file contains the structure of the webpage. It includes an input box to enter the city name, a button to fetch the weather, and a section to display the weather details.

2. **style.css**: A basic CSS file to style the webpage, ensuring the layout is user-friendly and responsive.

3. **script.js**: This file contains JavaScript code that fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on user input and displays the result dynamically on the page.

### Step 5: Deploy to Firebase Hosting

1. After completing your project, deploy it to Firebase Hosting:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

2. After successful deployment, Firebase will provide you with a URL where your project is hosted. You can access it through your browser.

### Step 6: Push to GitHub

1. Initialize a Git repository in your project folder if not already done:

```bash
git init
```

2. Add all the files to your Git repository:

```bash
git add .
```

3. Commit your changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

4. Create a new repository on GitHub and copy the repository URL.

5. Link your local repository to GitHub:

```bash
git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
```

6. Push the project to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

### Step 7: GitHub Repository Structure

After pushing the project to GitHub, your repository should look like this:

```
weather_dashboard/
│
├── public/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── style.css
│   └── script.js
│
├── .gitignore
├── firebase.json
├── .firebaserc
└── package.json
```

## Testing and Accessing Your App

After deploying, Firebase will give you a live URL where you can access your weather dashboard app. The app should display live weather data for any city entered in the input field. Here’s the live link to check out your project:
